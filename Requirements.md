    Requirements 
To successfully execute the   Secure Image Encryption and Decryption using AES Algorithm   project, the following requirements must be met. This ensures compatibility and smooth functioning of the software:

     1.   System Requirements    
-   Operating System  : Linux, Windows, or macOS.  
-   RAM  : At least 4 GB (8 GB recommended for handling large images).  
-   Storage  : Minimum 500 MB of free disk space.  
-   Processor  : Dual-core or higher with 64-bit architecture.  

     2.   Python Environment    
-   Python Version  : Python 3.6 or above (tested with Python 3.12).  
  Ensure Python is correctly installed and added to your system's PATH.  

     3.   Required Libraries    
Install the following Python libraries using pip:  

1.   Pillow  : For image processing tasks, such as opening, saving, and resizing images.  
   - Install using:  
     pip install Pillow

2.   PyCryptodome  : For implementing the AES encryption and decryption algorithms.  
   - Install using:  
     pip install pycryptodome

3.   Tkinter  : For the graphical user interface (GUI). This is usually included with Python installations, but if not:  
   - On Linux:  
     sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   - On Windows/macOS: Ensure it is enabled in your Python installer settings.  

     4.   Development Tools    
-   Code Editor/IDE  : Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or any Python-compatible editor for modifying or debugging the source code.  
-   Git  : For version control and accessing the project repository (if using GitHub).  

     5.   Image Requirements    
-   Supported Formats  : PNG, JPEG, BMP, and other commonly used formats.  
-   Image Size  : No strict limit, but high-resolution images may require more RAM and processing time.  

     6.   Optional Software    
-   Virtual Environment  : Using a virtual environment is recommended to isolate project dependencies.  
  - Create and activate a virtual environment:  
    python3 -m venv myenv
    source myenv/bin/activate    On Linux/macOS
    myenv\Scripts\activate       On Windows
  - Install libraries in the virtual environment.
By ensuring these requirements, you can set up and run the project seamlessly, with all functionalities operating as intended.
